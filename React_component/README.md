## 0. Commence with class components
Start this project with files from the the last task of the `React Props` project:

**Convert the App function into a React Class:**
- Modify the function within `App.js` to convert the App function into a React class
- Make sure that the tests are still passing

**Requirements:**
- At this point, reloading the App should display the exact same page as the last task
- The console in your browser should not show any error or warning
- File: `task_0/dashboard/src/App/App.js`

## 1. Lifecycles
**Add lifecycle to a component**

In the `App` Class:
- Add a props named `logOut` with the props type being `function`
- The default value for this property, should be an empty function
- Add an event listener when the component is mounted to listen to when the user is pressing down the keyboard keys
- When the user is pressing down the `control` and the `h` keys simultaneously, display the alert `Logging you out` and call the function `logOut`

**Add the tests**

In the test file for the App Class:
- Create a test to verify that when the keys `control` and `h` are pressed the `logOut` function, passed as a prop, is called and the alert function is called with the string `Logging you out`

**Requirements:**
- Make sure to remove the event listener when the component is unmounted
- In the test file, make sure to restore the alert function you mocked
- At this point, reloading the App should display the exact same page as the last task
- The console in your browser should not show any error or warning
- File: `task_1/dashboard/src/App/App.js, task_1/dashboard/src/App/App.test.js`

## 2. Handling Events
**Create a new handing event**

In the `Notifications` component:
- Convert the function into a React Class
- Make sure that the tests are still passing
- Create a new `markAsRead` function within the Notifications class. It accepts one argument: id(number)
- When the function is called, it logs to the console the message â€œNotification $id has been marked as read
- Pass the function `markAsRead` to the `NotificationItem` component as a property

In the `NotificationItem` Class:
- Modify the `li` element to call the new function `markAsRead` on click. It should send the id of the notification
- Define the new property type and the default property for the new properties

**Add the tests**

In the `Notifications` test file:
- Create a test, that will mockup the console.log function
- Check that when calling the function `markAsRead` on an instance of the component, the spy is being called with the right message

In the `NotificationItem` test file:
- Create a test, that will pass a spy as the `markAsRead` property
- Check that when simulating a click on the component, the spy is called with the right ID argument

**Requirements:**
- Make sure to bind the function `markAsRead` in your constructor to avoid unecessary re-rendering
- In the test file, make sure to restore the console function you mocked
- At this point, reloading the App should display the exact same page as the last task. Use the React Chrome Extension to make sure the Notifications component displays correctly
- The console in your browser should not show any error or warning
- File: `task_2/dashboard/src/Notifications/NotificationItem.js, task_2/dashboard/src/Notifications/NotificationItem.test.js, task_2/dashboard/src/Notifications/Notifications.js, task_2/dashboard/src/Notifications/Notifications.test.js`

## 3. Reusable comments & specialization

**Containment**

Create a new component named `BodySection`. The component does not know its children. It should output the following:
- A div with the class `bodySection`
- Within the div, a `h2` element containing a title passed as a prop
- Under the `h2` the children of `BodySection`

**Tips:**

Rendering the following
```jsx
<BodySection title="test">
  <p>test</p>
</BodySection>
```

Should generate:
```html
<div className="bodySection">
  <h2>test</h2>
  <p>test</p>
</div>
```
- File: `task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySection.js`

## 4. Specialization
in `task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySectionWithMarginBottom.js`, create a new component named `BodySectionWithMarginBottom`. The component does not know its children. It should output the following:
- A div with the class `bodySectionWithMargin`
- Within the div, a `BodySection` element with the same props passed to `bodySectionWithMarginBottom`

in `task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySectionWithMarginBottom.css`
- Set the style for the class `bodySectionWithMargin` with a margin bottom of 40px
- Import the styling into the `BodySectionWithMarginBottom` component

**Requirements:**
- Make sure to define the propTypes for both props
- Do not repeat each props manually and use the spread operator
- File: `task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySectionWithMarginBottom.js, task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySection.css`

## 5. Use the new components
**in `task_3/dashboard/src/App/App.js`, modify the `App` component:**
- Wrap the `CourseList` component with the newly created `BodySectionWithMarginBottom` component. The title should be `Course list`
- Wrap the `Login` component with the newly created `BodySectionWithMarginBottom` component. The title should be `Log in to continue`
- Using the `BodySection` component, add a new block with the title `News from the School`. The component should contain a paragraph with some random text
- File: `task_3/dashboard/src/App/App.js`

<sub>[Return to top](#react_component)</sub>

## 6. Test the new components
in `task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySection.test.js`:
- Add one test checking that shallowing the component should render correctly the children and one `h2` element

E.g. with the following code:

```jsx
<BodySection title="test title">
  <p>test children node</p>
</BodySection>
```

You should check that:
- There is one `h2` element and it includes the text `test title`
- There is one `p` element and it includes the text `test children node`

in `task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySectionWithMarginBottom.test.js`:
- Add one test checking that shallowing the component should render correctly a `BodySection` component and that the props are passed correctly to the child component

**Requirements:**

- Make sure that the CSS is correctly applied to your component
- The console in your browser should not show any error or warning
- File: `task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySection.test.js, task_3/dashboard/src/BodySection/BodySectionWithMarginBottom.test.js`

## 7. Create WithLogging HOC
We would like to add a way to log to the console every time a component has been mounted and every time it is about to unmount.

**To not repeat the same code everywhere, create a HOC component in `task_4/dashboard/src/HOC/WithLogging.js`:**
- The component should log to the console `Component NAME_OF_THE_WRAPPED_COMPONENT is mounted` on `componentDidMount()`
- The component should log to the console `Component NAME_OF_THE_WRAPPED_COMPONENT is going to unmount` on `componentWillUnmount()`
- Modify the `displayName` of the HOC to always display `WithLogging(NAME_OF_THE_WRAPPED_COMPONENT)` in the React Chrome Extension or for debugging
- `NAME_OF_THE_WRAPPED_COMPONENT` should be the name of the wrapped component or class. If the wrapped element has no name it should default to `Component`
- File: `task_4/dashboard/src/HOC/WithLogging.js`

<sub>[Return to top](#react_component)</sub>

## 8. Write a test for the HOC
**in `task_4/dashboard/src/HOC/WithLogging.test.js`, write some tests for the HOC component:**
- The first test should make sure `console.log` was called on mount and on unmount with `Component` when the wrapped element is pure html
- The second test should make sure `console.log` was called on mount and on unmount with the name of the component when the wrapped element is the `Login` component. `Component Login is mounted` and `Component Login is going to unmount` should be sent to the console

**Tips:**
- Writing a unit test for HOC can be difficult. Create a variable with the HOC wrapping a function rendering the React component or html. e.g. `WithLogging(() => <p />)`

**Requirements:**
- Make sure that the messages `Component Login is mounted` and `Component Login is going to unmount` are sent when loading the app
- In the test file, make sure to restore the console function you mocked
- The console in your browser should not show any error or warning
- File: `task_4/dashboard/src/HOC/WithLogging.test.js`
